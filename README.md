# Random Forest Classifier – Final Project

This repository contains the implementation of a **Random Forest** classifier, developed as a final project for  Math concepts for developers course.

## Project Description

The main goal of this project is to apply supervised learning techniques to classify data using the Random Forest algorithm. The implementation demonstrates a solid understanding of ensemble methods and decision tree-based classification.

## Features

- Custom implementation or use of `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Visualization of results (optional)

## What is Random Forest?

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges their results to improve classification accuracy and control overfitting. It is robust, scalable, and widely used in real-world applications.
